#  **Financial Data Analyzer**: Open-source NLP project simulating a use case of a Bloomberg terminal. 

### Project Description: 

The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive application that can intake financial data from various sources, process it, and analyze it to provide insightful trends and predictions. This project will utilize machine learning and natural language processing to handle structured and unstructured data, and big data technologies to manage vast quantities of information. The outcome of this application can help analysts, investors, or any user make informed financial decisions.

**Project Workflow:**

1. **Data Collection:** Implement various APIs and web scraping techniques to acquire financial data from multiple sources such as regulatory agencies, exchanges, central banks, buy-side and sell-side firms, websites, and news feeds.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the collected data to remove any inconsistencies, duplications, or errors. 

3. **Data Storage:** Use big data technologies like HBase, Hive, or MySQL Vitess to store and manage the large volumes of collected data.

4. **Data Processing and Analysis:** Implement Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze the data. This includes identifying trends, performing sentiment analysis on financial news, and predicting market movement based on historical data.

5. **Data Visualization:** Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Tableau to create interactive visualizations of the analyzed data. This will help users understand the results intuitively and make data-driven decisions.

6. **REST API:** Implement a REST API to allow users to interact with the application and access the analyzed data.

**Stack:**

- Python: Main programming language
- BeautifulSoup, Scrapy: For web scraping
- Pandas, Numpy: For data cleaning and processing
- Scikit-Learn, NLTK: For Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
- HBase, Hive: For big data storage
- Flask: To create REST API
- Docker: For containerization
- Kubernetes: For orchestration
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau: For data visualization

**Key Features:**

1. Reliable Financial Data: ingest data from a wide variety of sources, providing a holistic view of the market.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensures that the data used for analysis is accurate and reliable.

3. Natural Language Processing: Identify trends and make predictions based on historical data, and analyze sentiments in financial news(Twitter).

4. Interactive Data Visualization

5. REST API: Allows users to interact with the application and access the data.
