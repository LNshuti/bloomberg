#  **Financial Data Analyzer**: An open-source NLP project simulating a use case of a Bloomberg terminal. 

### Project Description: 

The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive application that can intake financial data from various sources, process it, and analyze it to provide insightful trends and predictions. This project will utilize machine learning and natural language processing to handle structured and unstructured data, and big data technologies to manage vast quantities of information. The outcome of this application can help analysts, investors, or any user make informed financial decisions.

**Project Workflow:**

1. **Data Collection:** Implement various APIs and web scraping techniques to acquire financial data from multiple sources such as regulatory agencies, exchanges, central banks, buy-side and sell-side firms, websites, and news feeds.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the collected data to remove any inconsistencies, duplications, or errors. 

3. **Data Storage:** Use big data technologies like HBase, Hive, or MySQL Vitess to store and manage the large volumes of collected data.

4. **Data Processing and Analysis:** Implement Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze the data. This includes identifying trends, performing sentiment analysis on financial news, and predicting market movement based on historical data.

5. **Data Visualization:** Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Tableau to create interactive visualizations of the analyzed data. This will help users understand the results intuitively and make data-driven decisions.

6. **REST API:** Implement a REST API to allow users to interact with the application and access the analyzed data.

**Languages and Tools:**

- Python: Main programming language
- BeautifulSoup, Scrapy: For web scraping
- Pandas, Numpy: For data cleaning and processing
- Scikit-Learn, NLTK: For Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
- HBase, Hive: For big data storage
- Flask: To create REST API
- Docker: For containerization
- Kubernetes: For orchestration
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau: For data visualization

**Key Features:**

1. Comprehensive Financial Data Collection: The application will be able to intake data from a wide variety of sources, providing a holistic view of the market.

2. Robust Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensures that the data used for analysis is accurate and reliable.

3. Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing: Provides the ability to identify trends and make predictions based on historical data, as well as analyze sentiments in financial news.

4. Scalable Data Storage: The use of big data technologies ensures the application can handle large volumes of data.

5. Interactive Data Visualization: Helps users understand the data and make informed decisions.

6. REST API: Allows users to interact with the application and access the data.

**End Goal:**

The end goal is to have an application that can intake financial data from various sources, process it, and analyze it to provide insightful trends and predictions to help users make informed financial decisions.
